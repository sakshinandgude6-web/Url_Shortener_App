You accidentally created a Git repository inside:
frontend-app
So Git treats it as:
➡ a nested repository (submodule style)
But for your project you want:
➡ one single repo for backend + frontend
//created login page in react checked the borwser devtools local storage to see if token is present there as user logs in token is sent as response and stored on the browser
// created dashboard page
