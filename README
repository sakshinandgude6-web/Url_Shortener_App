🚀 URL Shortener – Execution Guide (Beginner → Intermediate, No Code)
🧩 PHASE 1: Requirements & System Design (Days 1–3)

This phase decides whether your project is strong or messy later.

1️⃣ Functional Requirements – Why each matters
✔ Shorten long URLs

Core purpose.
You must support:

Any valid web URL

Fast generation

Unique short codes

✔ Redirect short → original

System must:

Be extremely fast

Handle thousands of requests

Never break links

✔ Track clicks

Used for:

Analytics

User insights

Ranking popular URLs

✔ User accounts

Needed for:

Personal dashboards

Security

Ownership of URLs

✔ View my URLs

Users should:

See only their own links

Track stats per link

Manage their links

✔ Delete URLs

Important for:

Data control

Privacy

GDPR-style compliance

✔ Expiry time (optional but powerful)

Makes your system:

Enterprise-ready

Useful for temporary links

Cleaner database

2️⃣ Non-Functional Requirements – How professional systems are judged
✔ Fast redirection

Means:

Minimum DB lookups

Possible caching

Optimized queries

✔ Secure

Protect against:

Fake URLs

Malware links

Brute force attacks

✔ Scalable design

So your system still works when:

10 users → 10,000 users

100 links → 10 million links

✔ Clean UI

Not just beauty:

Reduces user errors

Improves conversion

Looks professional in portfolio

🏗 High-Level Architecture – Why this design works
User (React)
   ↓
REST API (Node + Express)
   ↓
MongoDB
   ↓
Redirect Engine

Why this architecture is correct:

React handles presentation only

REST API handles logic and security

MongoDB handles persistence

Redirect engine ensures performance and correctness

This separation:

Improves maintainability

Makes scaling easier

Matches industry architecture

📐 Database Design – Deep Reasoning
User Schema

Purpose: identity + ownership

Why these fields matter:

_id → unique identity

email → login + uniqueness

password → authentication

createdAt → audit & analytics

URL Schema
Field	Why It Exists
originalUrl	Core data
shortCode	Fast lookup & redirect
userId	Ownership
clicks	Analytics
createdAt	History
expiresAt	Auto-clean + business logic
Why userId is critical

It allows:

“My URLs” feature

Per-user access control

Future billing / premium plans

📋 REST API Design – Professional Thinking

Each endpoint maps to a real business action.

Endpoint	Business Meaning
Register	Create identity
Login	Access system
Shorten URL	Core service
My URLs	User dashboard
Delete URL	User control
Redirect	Product delivery
Why REST is ideal here:

Stateless

Scalable

Easy frontend integration

Industry standard

🧑‍💻 PHASE 2: Backend Development (Days 4–14)

This is the brain of your system.

Step-by-step backend execution logic
1️⃣ Setup core system

Goal:

Server should start

DB should connect

APIs should be reachable

Success indicator:
✔ You can hit server and get a response

2️⃣ Authentication system

Why needed:

Prevent anonymous abuse

Personal dashboards

Secure URL ownership

Flow:

Register → Store user
Login → Generate token
Protected routes → Verify token


This ensures:

Only logged-in users manage URLs

Unauthorized access is blocked

3️⃣ URL shortening logic

Key thinking:

Before shortening:

Validate URL format

Check if URL already exists for user

Decide expiry rules

When generating:

Short code must be:

Unique

URL-safe

Short

Fast to generate

After saving:

Associate with user

Initialize clicks = 0

4️⃣ Preventing duplicates

Why important:

Avoid wasting storage

Avoid confusing users

Improve analytics accuracy

Logic:
Same user + same original URL
→ Return existing short URL instead of creating new

5️⃣ Expiry handling

When user accesses expired URL:

Show message OR

Redirect to custom expiry page

Why this matters:

Prevents dead data buildup

Enables premium features later

6️⃣ Redirect engine

This is your most performance-critical part.

Must:

Be extremely fast

Do minimal processing

Avoid heavy logic

Flow:

Receive shortCode
→ Find original URL
→ Increase clicks
→ Redirect immediately

🎨 PHASE 3: Frontend Development (Days 15–22)

This is where users judge your project.

Pages & Why they exist
Login / Register

Purpose:

Access control

User identity

Session creation

Dashboard

Purpose:

Central control panel

Shows stats, links, actions

Shorten URL Page

Purpose:

Core user interaction

Clean, simple, fast

My URLs

Purpose:

Ownership

Analytics

Delete & manage

UI Thinking

Your UI should:

Prevent invalid inputs

Show clear error messages

Display loading states

Confirm deletions

Professional UI = fewer bugs + better portfolio.

🧪 PHASE 4: Testing & Improvements (Days 23–25)

This separates student projects from real projects.

You test:

Wrong URLs

Empty input

Duplicate URLs

Expired URLs

Unauthorized access

Also improve:

User messages

API error responses

Input validation

🔐 PHASE 5: Security Enhancements (Days 26–27)

Why this phase matters:
Without this, your system is unsafe for public use.

You protect against:

Too many requests (rate limiting)

Malicious URLs

Token theft

URL injection

Brute force attacks

This makes your project interview-ready.

🚀 PHASE 6: Deployment (Days 28–30)

You convert your project from:

“Works on my laptop”
to
“Works for the world”

Backend deployment ensures:

Public API

Cloud-hosted DB

Secure env vars

Frontend deployment ensures:

Shareable URL

Mobile access

Portfolio-ready project

📄 PHASE 7: Documentation & Resume

This is where recruiters judge your communication skill.

Your README should tell:

What problem you solved

How your system works

What tech you used

How to use it

Where to see it live
