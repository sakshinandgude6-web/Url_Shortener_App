-----Backend Setup----

1. Install dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

2. Environment variables
   Create a .env file inside backend:
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

3. Start backend
   npm run dev
   or
   npm start

-----Frontend Setup-----

1. Install dependencies
   cd frontend-app
   npm install

2. Environment variables
   Create a .env file inside frontend-app:
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

3. Start backend
   npm start

-----API Overview-----

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                  |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| POST   | /api/auth/register | Register user                |
| POST   | /api/auth/login    | Login user                   |
| POST   | /api/url/shorten   | Create short URL (protected) |
| GET    | /api/url/my        | Get user URLs (protected)    |
| DELETE | /api/url/:id       | Delete URL (protected)       |
| GET    | /api/url/:id/stats | URL statistics (protected)   |
| GET    | /:shortCode        | Redirect to original URL     |

------Testing-----

API testing using Postman
A complete Postman collection was created to test:
Authentication flow
Token handling
Protected routes
URL creation
Redirection
Statistics
Delete functionality
Error handling and authorization failures
Automated token handling is implemented using Postman environment variables.
Manual and negative testing

The following scenarios were validated:
Empty input handling
Invalid URL format
Unauthorized access
Access by another user
Duplicate URL creation
Deleted resource access
Expired token access
MongoDB Atlas UI was used to verify data consistency and click tracking.

------Security Measures Implemented----

JWT authentication with expiry
Route protection using middleware
Ownership checks for all user resources
Password hashing using bcrypt
Input validation
URL scheme validation
